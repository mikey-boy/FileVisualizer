# File Visualizer

A GUI tool to help understand file formats (like ELF64). It will be able to present different views to the user (hex, description, etc) and show where specific information is actually stored within the file. The goal is for this to be a learning tool for reverse engineers, that is extensible enough to include many different types of files.
